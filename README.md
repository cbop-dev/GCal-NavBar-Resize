# GCal-NavBar-Resize
***UPDATE***: **This tool is OBSOLETE (and no longer works) with the latest versions of Google Calendar (since 2018), which has already a built-in menu-toggle button. This repo is here only for archival purposes.**


Javascript userscript (usable with greasemonkey) with resize and show/hide options for left-sidebar in Google Calendar. Now works with new Google Calendar UI (2017)! 

## Old Google UI:

## New (2017) UI:
